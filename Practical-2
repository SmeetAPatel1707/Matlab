% Aim :Generate a vector with values from 1 to 10 and calculate its mean, median, and standard deviation.
% Generate a vector with values from 1 to 10
vector = 1:10;

% Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation
mean_value = mean(vector);
median_value = median(vector);
std_deviation = std(vector);

% Display the results
fprintf('Vector: %s\n', mat2str(vector));
fprintf('Mean: %.2f\n', mean_value);
fprintf('Median: %.2f\n', median_value);
fprintf('Standard Deviation: %.2f\n', std_deviation);
